	KeyBoard: key press, key up ............
	Page : onload,.....
	forms: focus on input
	clipboard: cut, copy, paste

	When user click on the button : execute 3 functions 
	 	Add products to cart :   
			10% offer apply : func
		1500     5%		: func2  // stop here if it is 2nd order
		
		3000	 5% 		: func3	


Where user clicked/ on which element/target event triggered

	target
	currentTarget

Html Element has default behaviors 
	to prevent html default behaviors: preventDefault()

Regular Expression:
	A Regular expression is a sequence of characters that specifies a search pattern.	
	usually such patterns are used by string-searching alogorithms for "find" and "find and replace"

Modifiers
Bracket Expression
Meta Characters
Quantifiers


	Syntax:		/pattern/modifiers;

 
	
Modifier	Description

g		Perform a global match (find all matches rather than stopping after the first match)
i		Perform case-insensitive matching
m		Perform multiline matching

Brackets:

Expression	Description

[abc]		Find any character between the brackets
[^abc]		Find any character NOT between the brackets
[0-9]		Find any character between the brackets (any digit)
[^0-9]		Find any character NOT between the brackets (any non-digit)
(x|y)		Find any of the alternatives specified


Metacharacters:

Metacharacter	Description

.		Find a single character, except newline or line terminator
\w		Find a word character
\W		Find a non-word character
\d		Find a digit
\D		Find a non-digit character
\s		Find a whitespace character
\S		Find a non-whitespace character
\b		Find a match at the beginning/end of a word, beginning like this: \bHI, end like this: HI\b
\B		Find a match, but not at the beginning/end of a word
\0		Find a NULL character
\n		Find a new line character
\f		Find a form feed character
\r		Find a carriage return character
\t		Find a tab character
\v		Find a vertical tab character
\xxx		Find the character specified by an octal number xxx
\xdd		Find the character specified by a hexadecimal number dd
\udddd		Find the Unicode character specified by a hexadecimal number dddd


Quantifiers:
Quantifier	Description

n+		Matches any string that contains at least one n
n*		Matches any string that contains zero or more occurrences of n
n?		Matches any string that contains zero or one occurrences of n
n{X}		Matches any string that contains a sequence of X n's
n{X,Y}		Matches any string that contains a sequence of X to Y n's
n{X,}		Matches any string that contains a sequence of at least X n's
n$		Matches any string with n at the end of it
^n		Matches any string with n at the beginning of it
?=n		Matches any string that is followed by a specific string n
?!n		Matches any string that is not followed by a specific string n


RegExp Object Properties:

Property	Description

constructor	Returns the function that created the RegExp object's prototype
global		Checks whether the "g" modifier is set
ignoreCase	Checks whether the "i" modifier is set
lastIndex	Specifies the index at which to start the next match
multiline	Checks whether the "m" modifier is set
source		Returns the text of the RegExp pattern

RegExp Object Methods
Method		Description

exec()		Tests for a match in a string. Returns the first match
test()		Tests for a match in a string. Returns true or false
toString()	Returns the string value of the regular expression


var reg = /a{4,}/i;
var re1 = new RegExp('a');
